# Physics concepts

This is a growing collection (i.e. an on-going work in progress) of simulations, demonstration, and visualizations related to math and physics.
YouTube keeps reccomending Schroedinger equation, fluid mechanics, and general relativistic simulation videos and it made we want to make my own simulations!

## Current concepts (saved as Unity scenes):
1. _Graph_
   - Current main focus
   - A simple 2D graph
   - Goal: Customizable axes, gridlines, and datapoints/lines, including during runtime. Want to use as a debugging tool for other projects.
   - Intended to be something like a basic version of Python's Matplotlib, or Mathematica's Plot function
3. _universalgravitation_
   - N-body gravitational simulation
   - Goal: Many-body simulation to visualize the formation of planets, orbits, and other celestial structures like galactic filliments
   - Currently brute-forced, based on Unity Physics interactions. Much optomization needed. 
4. _2D Conservation of Momentum_
   - A simple demonstration of momentum conservation in elasic collisions
   - Goal: PhET-style simulation for momentum-related concepts, including collisions, center of mass velocity, explosions, etc.
   - Needs UI elements and some polish, but otherwise basic 2D elasic collisions work  
5. _WaveformFT_
   - Not very far along, on hold until _Graph_ is sufficiently functional
   - Goal: waveform analyzer, including spectrum calculations
