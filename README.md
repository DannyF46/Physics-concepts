# Physics concepts

This is a growing collection (i.e. an on-going work in progress) of simulations, demonstration, and visualizations related to math and physics.
YouTube keeps reccomending Schroedinger equation, fluid mechanics, and general relativistic simulation videos and it made we want to make my own simulations!

## Current demos (saved as Unity scenes):
1. _Graph_
   - A simple 2D graph, paired with some ODE solvers. Eventually want to plot PDEs
   - Intended to be something like a basic version of Python's Matplotlib, or Mathematica's Plot function
3. _UniversalGravitation_
   - N-body gravitational simulation, now powered by a compute shader!
4. _2D Conservation of Momentum_
   - A simple demonstration of momentum conservation in elasic collisions
   - Goal: PhET-style simulation for momentum-related concepts, including collisions, center of mass velocity, explosions, etc.
   - Needs UI elements and polish, but otherwise basic 2D elasic collisions are implemented
5. _WaveformFT_
   - Not very far along, on hold until I'm happy with _Graph_
   - Goal: waveform analyzer, including spectrum calculations
